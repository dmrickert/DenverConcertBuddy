This project contains multiple pieces!

The westwood_scrapey.py file holds a class that will scrape Westword's concert
table.  This is the best source for concert listings in Denver that I've found.

The denver_concert_buddy file interacts with the westwood_scrapey file to provide
a layer of abstraction.  You'll want to plug whatever bot into this guy, I used
GroupMe.

The groupme_buddy handles all of the groupme tasks including interpretting the
messages.  I have very basic text interpretation going on.  Unfortunately, this
requires python3 as the groupy library requires python3.

Be sure to copy groupme.template to groupme.cfg and add your own groupme credentials
if you choose to use groupme.

NOTE: While this project could do a lot of things, I have reached the point of
the most value for the time.  Feel free to add better language recognition, write
concerts to a database, so on and so forth.

You can crontab the whole thing with:
* * * * * python3 /path/to/groupme_buddy.py >> /path/to/logfile
